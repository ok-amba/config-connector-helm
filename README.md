Helm Charts for GKE Config Connector
## Dev branch helm releases
All helm charts are released to a public repository as a dev release everytime a chart is changed in a non-main branch. \
Each commit is build and published to the dev repo with a tag containing the chart version and an appended commit hash. \
The following is an example of depending on the devx-dashboard using the development OCI images.

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: devx-dashboard
    version: "2.1.0-0931bd05e59241b926cff38fb05a17890158bbd3"
    repository: "oci://europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/tinkerbell-329710/ok-public-registry/helm-dev"
```
The docker repository containing the OCI dev images is:

```
europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/tinkerbell-329710/ok-public-registry/helm-dev
```
